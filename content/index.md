Systems engineer, working in the cloud! I enjoy solving problems, automation, monitoring, and writing dirty bash scripts.

Here I’ll be writing about things I do at work so I won’t forget them and maybe someone else will also find them useful. I’ll probably also write about cooking and other random things I’m in to at the moment.

In my free time I enjoy playing guitar and hanging out with my daughter.
